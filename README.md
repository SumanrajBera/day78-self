# Self Task: Canvas Fireworks
- This was a combination of multiple things that I have learned like gravity and circular motion with sin-cos
- The fireworks happen based on click - we spawn 400 particles based on click and as the global alpha of article becomes lesser than 0 it disappears which we are setting using globalAlpha
- This was a fun experiment that made me think more about the things we at hand then start from that point like to get the particles angle we can use the area of circle and divide with the number of particles for getting angle of every particle.
